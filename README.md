# Booking App

This is Ruby on Rails SPA that lets you create appointments. It uses
Hotwire Turbo Frame and Turbo Stream to render all views in the root directory only.

The style has been made only with Tailwind.

This is a view if the index:
![pic1](app/assets/images/pic1.png)


This is a view of the New in the index:
![pic2](app/assets/images/pic2.png)


This is a view of the Edit in the index:
![pic3](app/assets/images/pic3.png)

All the app functioning happens in the root (Localhost:3000 in the case of local)

## Project Requirements

Build a simple appointment application using Hotwire from rails.

 1: The app should be on one page. 
 
 2: Use tailwind css or bulma for styling.
